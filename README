# 3. Game description and the course of the game:
- The game is played by two players (a human plays "with the computer").
- The playing field is a chessboard with 8x8 squares. Each player has 3 rows of pawns, in total a player has 12 pawns.
- The game starts with the player who has the white pawns. He moves his pawn one space diagonally. The game is played where the player can move.
- The second player (computer) then does the same.
- When a player has a "beat" i.e. his pawn stands on the opponent's pawn slant, he must make a beat. The beaten cone disappears from the board and the player who was beaten has less cones. If there is a beat available the player has to perform it.
- When a player reaches the opposite wall of the board his pawn turns into a queen. A queen can, unlike a pawn, move more than one half but still only diagonally. 
- The winner is the player who has pawns left on the board
