# GAME RULES:

Arrangement of pieces to start the game.
The classic checkers game (also known as Brazilian checkers) is played on a board with a size of 8 Ã— 8 fields,
colored alternately light and dark.

Each player starts the game with twelve pieces (one white, the other - red) placed on the darker squares
of the board on which they move. They are set in the illustrations.

As the first move, white pieces are played, and then the players take turns taking turns.

The goal of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces (including queens) or to block
all remaining on the board, depriving the opponent of the possibility of making a move.
If none of the players is able to achieve this achievement (each player will make 15 moves with
queens without reducing the number of pieces remaining on the board), a full draw.

The pieces may move forward one square diagonally to empty spaces.

Hitting a price pawn by jumping an adjacent opponent's (or queen) pawn to a square directly behind
him diagonally (this square must be empty). Captured pieces are removed from the board after giving a move.

Pawns can beat the newest and ahead.

In one move you can move more than one capture with the same pawn, jump over successive pawns or queens of the opponent.

Beats are obligatory. When there are several smack games, the game must do all of them.
 When capturing, you cannot jump over the same pawn or queen more than once.

A pawn that reaches the last row of the board becomes a queen, and if it passes through the last row in one move as
a result of multiple capture, but does not mean any move on it, it does not become a queen and the move ends as a pawn.

Queens may move in one movement any position forward or diagonally, stopping in free spaces.

Hitting the queen is possible with a break on the diagonal line and by jumping the opponent's piece (or the queen),
 behind him there must be at least one free space - the queen jumps to any of these squares and may still capture
 on the same or perpendicular line.
